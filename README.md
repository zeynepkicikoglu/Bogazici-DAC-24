# DATA ANALYSIS COMPETITION 2024 (BUYAK/ BOGAZICI UNIVERSITY)

- Case 1: YapÄ± Kredi Teknoloji Project
- Overview
Fraud is a major problem for merchants. Criminals use a wide variety of methods to attack organizations across systems, channels, processes and products. The development of fraud detection methods is thus of crucial importance. Fraud detection is a challenging problem because fraudsters make their best efforts to make their behaviour look legitimate. Another difficulty is that the number of legitimate records is far greater than the number of fraudulent cases.

The aim of the challenge is to find the best way to process and analyze basket data from one of the retailer partners in order to detect fraud cases. Using these basket data, fraudulent customers should be identified and then refused in the future.

Evaluation
The performance of your model will be evaluated using the Area Under the Precision-Recall Curve (PR-AUC). This metric is particularly well-suited for imbalanced datasets, which are common in fraud detection scenarios where fraudulent transactions are a minority.

Note: This implementation corresponds to the average_precision_score metric of sklearn.


-Case 2: Value Analytics Labs Project
-Description
All the needed information is in the world document.(in pdf)

Evaluation
Evaluation will be on 'Progression Probability' dataset that you will be creating at the end of Question-3. The mean absolute error (MAE) metric will be the evaluation metric.
